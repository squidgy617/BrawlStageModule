Calculated using this code:
Test
HOOK @ $800249e4
{
    lis    r6, 0x8049 # original instruction
    cmpwi r3, 0xf
    bne skipStuff
    nop
    skipStuff:
}

Breakpoint to the nop (in code it should be the first nop in the hook). When the enemy fires a projectile, you will hit the nop. r4 will contain the memory allocation. This is multiplied by 32/0x20(?). This gets you the total allocation for the projectile.

I have no idea if this is actually accurate but it's my best guess on how this works based on my observations. It's possible multiplying by 32 makes no sense.

Enemies listed are all enemies (aside from bosses) that I know spawn projectiles, might be missing some.
